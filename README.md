In this project, I created the following recommendation systems using the [MovieLens dataset:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset)

- Nonpersonalized recommendation system - based top movies rated by the user
*”If everyone likes this, you might also like it.”*
- Content-based recommendation system - based on the movie genres
*”If you like this, you might also like that.”*
- Collaborative filtering - based on the ratings of the movie
